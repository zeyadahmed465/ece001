        <h2>programing Languages</h2>
<p> Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
    These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
    There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most importan The language is broad in scope, having been developed for, and applied effectively in, such diverse areas as microprogramming, switching theory, operations research, information retrieval, sorting theory, structure of compilers, search procedures, and language translation. The language permits a high degree of useful formalism. It relies heavily on a systematic extension of a small set of basic operations to vectors, matrices, and trees, and on a family of flexible selection operations controlled by logical vectors. Illustrations are drawn from a variety of applications.t, relevant and in-demand of these languages <p>
