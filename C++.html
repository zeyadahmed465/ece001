<p><font size ="7">C++</font> is a popular programming language.
C++ is used to create computer programs.C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).C++ is an object oriented language and some concepts may be new. Take breaks when needed, and go over the examples as many times as needed.
